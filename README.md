# My Portfolio
**My Portfolio indicating my skill and what i have been able to achieve.**
## Project Details
The project has been done with `HTML` and `CSS`. There are several css files which were necessary to create a good responsive site.
## Responsiveness
I opted to uses `media queries` and create a link to the respective CSS files unlike using them in the main CSS file which I thought would be cumbersome.
